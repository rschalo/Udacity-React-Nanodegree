# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project.


# What the project does

This project tracks the reading status of books in a database. These books can be assigned to one of three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Have Read. If a user would like to remove the book from their bookshelves then they can select None. If a user would like to search for and add books to the project then they can hit the + button at the bottom right of the app and search for a new book. Once the book has been searched for, a user can assign the book to one of their bookshelves.
